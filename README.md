# M3_Wiper-control-system
This project is a wiper control system for a car wiper, which regulates the wiper's functioning speed based on rain circumstances. The major function of the system in the automobile unit is to keep the windscreen clean enough to enable adequate view at all times.
The stmcube 32 IDE is being used to mimic this project.
# Guidelines
* For simulation, use the STM32cube IDE programme; for coding, use Visual Studio code.
* All functions should produce proper results.
* Create a Makefile with targets for compiling and testing, as well as analysis and coverage.
* When writing the code, follow best practises.
