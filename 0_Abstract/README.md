## PROJECT TITLE : WIPER CONTROL SYSTEM
* This project is a **Wiper control system**, which regulates the speed of a car wiper in response to rain conditions. The major function of the system in the automobile unit is to keep the windscreen clean enough to enable adequate view at all times.
* The **stmcube 32 IDE** is being used to mimic this project.
# ABSTRACT
1) The wiper speed control system regulates the wiper's operation speed based on the rain conditions.
2) It removes rainfall and other liquids off the windscreen of the vehicle.
3) The previous method required annual wiper activation, and pulling up the wiper was a tough job to operate.
4) As a result, this strategy is recommended as a solution to the problem. The project's goals are to provide automatic transmission to enhance the ageing of car equipment.
5) Most cars have two wipers, one for the back window and the other for the front.
6) The rubber blade, the wiper arm that holds the blade, a spring linkage, and components of the wiper pivots are visible from the automobiles.
7) The warning gear is capable of generating the force required to move the wipers as quickly as they must.
8) We now have an automated control wiper system that will automatically return to its initial position if we stop wiping in the middle of a procedure. This is the new wiper system behind the wiper arm.
9) The principle of operation of the proposed wiper system is similar to that of other conventional wipers now in use.
